MSBA Computer Assignment 02 - Spam Mail Detection by Naive Bayes
In this file, I used Naive Bayes to detect spam mails.
I imported all the needed packages, defined a library of words to look for and delete, 
  created labels, used Gaussian Naibe Bayes on the training model, and used test training model to predict test data labels.
